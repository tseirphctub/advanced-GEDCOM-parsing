# advanced-GEDCOM-parsing
Here's a more sophisticated Python script for advanced GEDCOM parsing:
Advanced GEDCOM parsing involves handling more complex scenarios, nested structures, and various edge cases within the GEDCOM format. 
Below is an enhanced version of the parser that deals with:

Nested structures: Handling child nodes within a structure.

Multiple levels: Properly managing the hierarchical nature of GEDCOM data.

Custom tags: Recognizing and storing custom tags which are not part of the standard GEDCOM specification.

Error handling: Implementing better error management for malformed lines or unexpected structures.

Explanation:

Level Management: Uses a stack (level_stack) to track the current level of nesting, ensuring we correctly go up or down the tree as the level changes.

Path Tracking: current_path helps in building the correct path through nested structures, allowing for multi-level attributes.
Flexible Data Storage: The data structure can handle both flat and nested data. For tags that appear multiple times (like multiple CHIL in a FAM), it uses lists to store these values.

Error Handling: Basic error logging for unparsable lines.

This parser will handle complex GEDCOM files better, but remember that GEDCOM can have many custom tags or structures not covered here. You might need to further adapt this parser based on the exact nature of the files you're dealing with or add more sophisticated error handling and data validation.
